      <h3>I study as all students do . From a young age theory has bored me so i always found solace in Mathematics as it challenged my mind and fed my curiosity. As time progressed computer science was introduced to me .I still remember how it felt when the fisrt code i typed compiled properly. Computers became a new domain for me and i loved it.</h3>
